# PiCamera "stuff"

Mostly related to playing around with the NoIR camera and RPi Zero

## Requirements

Apart from the obvious being the camera:

`sudo apt-get install python3-picamera python-picamera python-opencv`

I used the stock apt packages here, will need to test virtualenv
and pip packages, it seems someone has made a build of opencv for
python3, which is nice.
